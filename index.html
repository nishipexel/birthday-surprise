            So finally, it's your birthday today! Wishing you a very happy birthday, Taxila! 🎉  
            May this day bring you the utmost joy and happiness. Thank you for always being there for me, helping me out, and, in a way, completing me 🥰 whether it's correcting my grammar, finishing my food, or helping me become a more extroverted person. We've had plenty of fights in between, but honestly, they’re part of the fun! 🥹  
            Lastly, I hope you enjoy your special day, and a big congratulations on turning 21! 🥳❤  

            P.S. You wouldn’t find someone better than me, and neither would I, So..😌
